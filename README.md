# New Night

While living in Toronto with my classmates during co-op, we had difficulty finding a venue for a night out downtown based on our preferences.

As a result, my friend and I came up with a mobile solution that would allow us and users to select preferences for the type of experience they want during a night out in downtown Toronto and return the most accurate results based on these preferences. My classmate created the designs and I developed the application.

New Night utilizes the Google Places API along with a REST API I developed using Spring Boot. 

The Spring Boot app connects to a MySQL database containing additional details about venues in Toronto.
This allowed us to extend the filters available with the Places API to include options such as music genre, venue size and dress code.
